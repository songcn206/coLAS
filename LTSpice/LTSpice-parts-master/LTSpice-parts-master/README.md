# LTSpice-parts
Parts for LTSpice commonly used by electronics hobbyists (with usage instructions).

LTSpice is a wonderful circuit simulator, but it doesn't include a lot of parts commonly used by hobbyists (e.g. the LM324 op amp), and adding 3rd party parts can be a challenge for newcomers.

**This github project aims to be both a collection of these common "jellybean" components, as well as instructions on how to use them in LTSpice.**
