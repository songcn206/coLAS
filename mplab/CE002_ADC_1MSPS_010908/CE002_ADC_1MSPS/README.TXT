      Readme for Example dsPIC30F Workspace and Project
     ---------------------------------------------------

This file provides a brief description of files and folders provided
in the accompanying workspace.

This folder contains the following files:
1. DS92002.pdf
        This file provides a description of the functionality demonstr-
        ated by the example source code.

2. ADC_1MSPS.mcp, ADC_1MSPS.mcw,
   ADC_1MSPS.mcs
        These are MPLAB® IDE workspace and project files that may be
        used to examine, build, program and debug the example source
        code.

This folder contains the following sub-folders:

1. gld
        This folder contains a linker script file for the example project.
        This file is used for building the project for a 30F4011 device.
        This file simply includes the relevant device linker script, 
        "p30F4011.gld" and the relevant MPLAB® C30 library files, 
        "libdsp-coff.a", "libc-coff.a", and "libm-coff.a" or 
        "libdsp-elf.a", "libc-elf.a", and "libm-elf.a" from their installed 
        location. 

2. h
        This folder contains C header files useful in building this
        project. Device register and bit definitions are provided in
        the "p30F4011.h" file, which may be found in the installation folder
        of the MPLAB® C30 toolsuite.

3. hex
        This folder contains three file types - coff, hex and map.
        These are files generated by the MPLAB® C30 toolsuite on build
        operation performed within MPLAB® IDE. The *.map file contains
        details on memory allocation for various variables, constants
        and dsPIC30F instructions specified in the source and library
        code. The *.hex file contains a binary file that may be
        programmed into the dsPIC30F device. The *.coff file contains
        a binary file that is used by MPLAB® IDE for simulation.

4. source
        This folder contains all the C and Assembler source files (*.c,
        *.s) used in demonstrating the described example. This folder
        also contains a sub-folder named "obj" that stores compiled
        object files generated when the project is built.
